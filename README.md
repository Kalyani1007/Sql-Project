# Sql-Project


In this project, I am going to analyze Apple's app store data. I have downloaded Dataset from Kaggle.

Insight from project 

1. Paid apps have better ratings
2. apps supporting many languages between 10 and 30 have the highest rating
3. Finance and book where existing apps have lower user ratings
4. Apps with longer descriptions have a better rating
5. A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5
